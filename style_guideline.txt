style guideline: 

Overall look: The overall look of the website will be calm with soothing dark colors. The logo will be the only "flashy region" of the website.

Color Theme: Blue-green and dark blue are the main colors of the website. Individual sections may have other colors that are complementary to blue-green in the future. The navigation bar will be a dark gray. 

Here are the colors currently chosen (and added) to the css of the website

 	header background:#128f76
	background:#2c3e50
	navigation bar:#333
	sections color:#2c3e50 (subject to changes with the addition of more elements)
	images background: white
	logo color background: transparent

Typography: Courier is the main font of the website and white is the color that is used for the text in the entire website. font size may vary depending on the purpose.

Here are the text fonts, color and size of our current css:

	default text: Courier/White/15px
	main h1: Courier/White/500%
	h2 and h3: Courier/White
	navigation text: Courier/White/15px
	*the text size in each sections may vary for esthetic purposes

Links:
links won't be present in full length in the website

Navigation bar and buttons:
These elements are made accordingly to the color theme

Other elements:
some elements may contain more colors than the one used for the "skeleton" of the website, but they all have to be complementary to these.
